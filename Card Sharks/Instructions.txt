Card Sharks is a very early Game Show.

Controls:

The mouse controls everything, so click to do an action.

Instructions:

The goal of the game is to not lose all your money while getting as much as you can.
You start with a base card in the bottom left hand side face up.
The +100 and -100 can increase and decrease your bet.
You will want to bet if the next card is either higher or lower than the base card you have.
This can be done by clicking on the down arrow for lower or the up arrow for higher.
Whether you win or lose the next card in the row replaces the current card you have.
After you reach the last row at the top and you still have money left you win.
If you run out of money the game will restart.

For best gameplay experience as in I messed up on screen coordinates, play in 640x480.
There is music in the game, but it is the Card Shark theme song and it will get old very quickly.

This game is not for sale, nor should you use it as your own game.
