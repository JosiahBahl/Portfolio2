I had a dream about this java program for help on finding bugs for the group game I am working on.
The original plan was to make it accept .txt files then send those to your e-mail,
I decided to go the easier and user friendly path of having them write a message.

The STMP Authenticator is not my code, and I had to look up some of the sending message code,
the important thing is that I understand it though.

Now this does use a third party jar file called javax.mail and it will need to be downloaded and imported into the package.
Other then that I have found I can only use the Gmail host, the other ones do not work as of yet.

Also this is not for sale nor for use as your own, do what I did and look this shit up; its easier to learn then one might think.
